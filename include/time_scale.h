/**
 * \ingroup mdegv
 * \brief Time scale configuration that assigns a group number to every energy
 * term. Up to 32 different group numbers are supported, from 0 to 31.
 *
 * This class must:
 *    - implement a C++ style `.at(arg)` member function where `arg` is the name
 *      of an energy term;
 *    - return the group to which `arg` belongs;
 *    - throw an exception if `arg` is an invalid energy name.
 *
 * If the k-th bit of the flag is set, all of the energies in `group k` will be
 * calculated.
 *
 * #### Example 1.
 * Every energy term in the Verlet integrator is computed at every time-step.
 * Therefore, all of the terms are in the same group. This group (G) can be any
 * number from 0 to 31. Accordingly, the flag must be \f$ 2^G \f$.
 *
 * #### Example 2.
 * There are usually two groups, "high frequency" (fast) and "low frequency"
 * (slow), of energy terms in the RESPA integrator. If one decides to assign 3
 * and 5 to these two groups, respectively, `tsconfig.at("ebond")` shall return
 * 3 and `tsconfig.at("evdw")` shall return 5.
 *
 * The values of flags shall be:
 *    - 8 (\f$ 2^3 \f$) for only the fast terms;
 *    - 32 (\f$ 2^5 \f$) for only the slow terms;
 *    - 40 (8 + 32) for both groups.
 *
 * \note To use a new energy term in an existing integrator, the force field
 * developers are responsible to update the time scale configuration of this
 * integrator.
 *
 * \todo Add or modify time scale configurations by keywords, e.g.
 * `"TIME-SCALE RESPA VDWTERM 0"`.
